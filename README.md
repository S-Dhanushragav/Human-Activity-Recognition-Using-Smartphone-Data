# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphone-Data
The project focused on preprocessing accelerometer and gyroscope data to predict activities like walking, sitting, and standing. Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were implemented, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation applied. Random Forest achieved the accuracy.
